# Nodejs API template

Fairly lightweight setup.

## What's included

- Express server with CORS enabled, helment and bodyparser, morgan for logs
- MongoDB adapter logic (mongoose wiring, check `/utils/database`)
- Routes sample with async logic (check `/routes/api/v0.1/sample.js`)
- JSDocs and swagger integration for OpenAPI 3, docs are hosted on `/api/v0.1/docs`


## Future plans

- Add boilerplate for other databases as well
- Add some middleware samples
